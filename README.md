Context: The data comes from YourCab, a Bangalore-based city-specific cab company that operated around 2013â€”before app-based services like Uber or Ola were popular. Customers booked cabs through a desktop website, mobile website, or call center (not via mobile apps).

Business Problem: Cancellations due to car unavailability caused penalties for the company (the later the cancellation, the higher the penalty). The dataset is being used to build a predictive model to identify bookings at high risk of cancellation (due to car unavailability) before confirmation, so the company can avoid accepting them.

Scope of Data:

Focuses only on cancellations from the company side (car unavailability), not customer-driven cancellations.

Covers different travel types: hourly rentals, point-to-point, and long-distance trips.
